    <hr>

    <p>The peso closed at <strong>57</strong> against the dollar yesterday, after shedding 19.2 centavos from Monday‘s 56.808 finish, data from the Bankers Association of the Philippines showed.</p>

    <p>The local currency opened weaker at 56.85 and lost steam to hit an intraday low of 57. The peso‘s intraday high was at 56.85.</p>

    <p>Trading volume fell by 30.8 percent to $1.1 billion yesterday from $1.59 billion on Monday.</p>

    <p>It was the peso‘s <em>weakest close in nearly 17 months</em>, or since its 57.375 to $1 finish on Nov. 22, 2022.</p>

    <p>The peso last crossed the 57 to $1 level on Sept. 6, 2022.</p>

    <p>ING Bank senior economist Nicholas Mapa said a broad dollar strength swept through currencies in Asia as US treasury yields spiked overnight.</p>

    <p>“Yields charged higher as stronger-than-expected US data and the prospects of higher oil prices forced a majority to rethink the US Federal Reserve outlook for rate cuts,” Mapa said. <b>— Keisha Ta-asan</b></p>
